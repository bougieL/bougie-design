# Getting Start

Bougie Design React is dedicated to providing a **good development experience** for programmers. Make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)(> 8.0.0) correctly.

> Before delving into Bougie Design React, a good knowledge base of [React](https://reactjs.org) and [JavaScript ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) is needed.

---

## Compatibility

Bougie Design React supports all modern browsers and IE9+.

We offer very limited support for IE9/10 which means some styles and animations will be mininal for them. Also, we use Flex layout in a few components.

> Note: Different than Bougie Design, Bougie Design Pro supports IE11+.

Polyfills are needed for IE browsers. We recommend [babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) for it. You can set `targets` config if you are using [umi](http://umijs.org/).

Bougie Design 3.0 supports both React 15 and 16 but we strongly suggest React 16 for better performance and fewer bugs.

## Customized Work Flow

If you want to customize your work flow, we recommend using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to build and debug code.

Also, you can use any [scaffold](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#boilerplates) available in the React ecosystem.

## Import on Demand

```jsx
import { Button } from 'bougie-design'
```
