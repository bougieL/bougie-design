# Use in TypeScript

Let's create a TypeScript project by using `create-react-app`, then import `bougie-design` step by step.

---

## Install and Initialization

Ensure your system has installed latest version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Create a new project named `bougie-design-demo-ts` using yarn.

```bash
$ yarn create react-app bougie-design-demo-ts --typescript
```

If you are using npm (we will use yarn in the following instructions, it's ok to replace yarn with npm)

```bash
$ npx create-react-app bougie-design-demo-ts --typescript
```

Then we go inside `bougie-design-demo-ts` and start it.

```bash
$ cd bougie-design-demo-ts
$ yarn start
```

Open browser at http://localhost:3000/, it renders a header saying "Welcome to React" on the page.

## Import bougie-design

```bash
$ yarn add bougie-design
```

Modify `src/App.tsx`, import Button component from `bougie-design`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Button } from 'bougie-design'
import './App.css'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Button type="primary">Button</Button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

Ok, reboot with `yarn start`, you should now see a blue primary button displayed on the page. Next you can choose any components of `bougie-design` to develop your application. Visit other workflows of `create-react-app` at its [User Guide ](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Advanced Guides

We are successfully running bougie-design components now but in the real world, there are still lots of problems about bougie-design-demo-ts. For instance, we actually import all styles of components in the project which may be a network performance issue.

Now we need to customize the default webpack config. We can achieve that by using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) which is one of create-react-app's custom config solutions.

Import react-app-rewired and modify the `scripts` field in package.json. Due to new [react-app-rewired@2.x](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired#alternatives) issue, you shall need [customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra) along with react-app-rewired.

```
$ yarn add react-app-rewired customize-cra
```

```diff
/* package.json */
"scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
+   "start": "react-app-rewired start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
+   "build": "react-app-rewired build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test",
+   "test": "react-app-rewired test",
}
```

Then create a `config-overrides.js` at root directory of your project for further overriding.

```js
module.exports = function override(config, env) {
  // do stuff with the webpack config...
  return config
}
```

## Alternative ways

You can also follow instructions in [Use in create-react-app](/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app.en-US.md), then use to setup the TypeScript development environment by yourself.

And you can use [react-scripts-ts-bougie-design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts-bougie-design) which includes ts-import-plugin, react-app-rewired, scss, less and etc. You can create a new project that without any configurations by running just one command.
